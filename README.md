Golang Pattern Programs

This repository contains a collection of pattern printing programs written in Go (Golang).
The goal of this project is to practice Go syntax, loops, conditionals, and logical thinking through various pattern problems.

📌 About the Project

Pattern programs are a great way to understand:

Nested loops

Control structures

Logical problem solving

Basic Go programming concepts

All the programs in this repository are implemented using Golang and are beginner-friendly.

🧩 Patterns Covered

This repository includes programs such as:

Star patterns

Number patterns

Alphabet patterns

Pyramid patterns

Inverted patterns

Hollow patterns

Combined patterns

(Each pattern is written as a separate Go program for clarity.)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Go (Golang)

Tools: Go compiler (go run, go build)

Editor: Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

▶️ How to Run the Programs
